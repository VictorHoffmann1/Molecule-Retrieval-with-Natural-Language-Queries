# Molecule-Retrieval-with-Natural-Language-Queries
The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to retrieve molecules (graphs) using natural language queries. Natural language and molecules encode information in very different ways, which leads to the exciting but challenging problem of integrating these two very different modalities.
